#**2. Macro Costing Tools**
Sometimes, you want to look before you leap. Your mom told you to do it and she's a smart lady. VETRO FiberMap^tm^ gives you the tools you need in order to look at your costs and return on investment for your fiber projects before you build, whether it's for one street, for a neighborhood, or for a whole town. Costing tools are accessed through the left sidebar by clicking on the "costing" button on the left side of the screen. There are two ways to define a project area, either by defining a neighborhood area for neighborhood-level analysis or by using VETRO FiberMap^tm^'s routing analytics to find the shortest distance from a network connection point to a given location on the map. In addition to calculating costs and ROI, both of these tools will give you a wide range of detailed information about the area you are considering for a potential fiber expansion, including counts of customers, leads, businesses, residences, structures, and road-miles, as well as the ability to export detailed address and contact lists for use in direct mailing campaigns.


##**2.1. Neighborhood-level analysis**
A neighborhood can be defined at any size or level of detail, as precisely or abstractly as you would like. Whether you want to just get a rough idea of cost and return with a few clicks, or to download an address list that only includes the exact houses and businesses to be passed by a planned network, VETRO FiberMap^tm^'s costing tools are for you. 


###**2.1.1. Define neighborhood** 
<div class="doc-section col-md-12">
  <div class="col-md-8">
In order to examine an area's details, first you have to define the area. To begin, simply click on the <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\2 - Macro Costing\2.1.1. Costing button2.png" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle"> button on the left side of your browser window in order to open the costing tools in the left sidebar. Then with the "Neighborhood-Level Analysis" toggle on, click on the <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\2 - Macro Costing\2.1.1. Define Neighborhood Button2.png" height="25" style="vertical-align:middle"> button.  

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
  <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\4 - Data Management\2.1.1. Define Neighborhood Button.png">
  </div>
</div>

<div class="doc-section col-md-12">
  <div class="col-md-8">  
Once clicked, your cursor will change into a cross-hair icon. You can click anywhere on the map to begin defining the boundary of your neighborhood. You can make the neighborhood as abstract or as precise as you would like. If you draw it roughly while zoomed out, you can zoom in and change it after it has been completed. You can easily zoom in or out while you are drawing the neighborhood using the scroll wheel on your mouse or by using the zoom controls in the upper left corner of the map window. 
 
Simply click once on the first point to finish the neighborhood. Once the neighborhood has been completed its details will appear in the left sidebar. You can have as many neighborhood analyses open at the same time as you want, which makes comparing alternative projects easy as pie. As a matter of practice, having a hundred neighborhood analyses open at the same time is just messy. Didn't your mom teach you how to keep your room clean?

</div>



###**2.1.2. Costing Display** 

In the simple view, you will see four key pieces of information:

<div class="doc-section col-md-12">
  <div class="col-md-8">
  <ol>
    <li>Estimated Annual Revenue</li>
    <li>Estimated Cost</li>
    <li>Payback Period</li>
    <li>Projected Customers</li>
  </ol>


 </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
  <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\4 - Data Management\2.1.2. Costing_display.png">
  </div>
</div>

Of course, you can't find the ROI for a neighborhood without sales and business data specific to your company. Well, we could give you a number, but without a firm basis in fact it wouldn't be worth much more than a wooden nickel. That's why all of the neighborhood-specific data on cost and return will be specific to your business' experience and history. Simply enter your expectations and assumptions in VETRO FiberMap^tm^'s Settings and Preferences. For detailed instructions on this process, go to [2.3. Settings and Preferences variable options](#section-2.3.).  

For more detailed information about the neighborhood, click on <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\2 - Macro Costing\2.1.2.p3. Detailed_Calculations.png" height="18" style="vertical-align:middle"> to expand the list. Five additional pieces of information will then become visible:

<div class="doc-section col-md-12">
  <div class="col-md-8">
  <ol start="5">
    <li>Number of Leads</li>
    <li>Number of Businesses</li>
    <li>Number of Residences</li>
    <li>Number of Structures</li>
    <li>Number of Road Miles</li>
  </ol>


 </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
  <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\4 - Data Management\2.1.2.p3. Detailed_Calculations2.png">
  </div>
</div>

The number of leads present in a neighborhood will only be visible if you are enrolled in a DemandGen (Demand Generation) website service, which will enable community members both to express their own insatiable desire for broadband service and to recruit their neighbors on your behalf. Each community member desiring broadband service will enter their information on the DemandGen website, which will then appear as a geocoded lead point in VETRO FiberMap^tm^ and will be counted in neighborhood costing details.

If you are done with your neighborhood your neighborhood, just press the <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\2 - Macro Costing\2.1.2.p5. Delete.png" height="25" style="vertical-align:middle"> button. But don't delete it if you only made a simple mistake! It's easy to adjust your boundaries after the fact and your neighborhood calculations will automatically adjust on the fly, as described in [2.1.4 Neighborhood Editing](#section-2.1.2.2.). Unless you enjoy tracing neighborhoods as much as we do, in which case, you are welcome to delete and draw as many neighborhoods as you feel like. It's your party, after all!


###**2.1.3. Neighborhood Data Export Tools**

<div class="doc-section col-md-12">
  <div class="col-md-8">
Need to take the neighborhood data on the road, pass it from department to department, bring it into other software packages? No problem! You can easily download residential addresses and information, detailed business information, and utility pole data present in the neighborhood you have defined, making direct mailing campaigns and CRM integration a breeze. Simply click on the "Export type selection" button (<img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\2 - Macro Costing\2.1.3. Export_type_selection_button.png" height="30" style="vertical-align:middle">) and select the type of information you want to download, then click <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\2 - Macro Costing\2.1.3.p1. Export.png" height="30" style="vertical-align:middle">. The information will then be downloaded as a CSV file to the download folder location set in your browser settings, and can be opened with any common spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice.

Our team builds the underlying premise data for your network from the best-available public data sources, combining municipal assessing data and GIS files with e911 address points and building footprints to retain the best elements of each. Data exports of premise data can thus contain owner name and mailing address in addition to the physical address of the property, the number of residential units and buildings on that property, and both general and specific property types. 

Business data is from Pitney-Bowes World Premium Points of Interest and contains a wide range of pertinent business information, listed as following:

1. Name
1. Address
1. City
1. State
1. Zip
1. Telephone
1. Division
1. Group
1. Class
1. Sub Class
1. Employees
1. Year
1. Sales

Whether utility pole data is from the municipality or your own records, you may improve it through on-the-ground information building and Fulcrum integration, allowing your employees to collect information, even photographs, with their mobile devices and upload that information into VETRO FiberMap^tm^, where it can be managed, shared across departments, and referenced easily at anytime in your map window or by export to a spreadsheet. 


###**2.1.4. Neighborhood editing**  

<div class="doc-section col-md-12">
  <div class="col-md-8">
  Sometimes it's hard to be perfect the first time around. If you included the wrong street in your neighborhood, never fear! You can always change it after the fact. Simply double-click on your neighborhood polygon in the map window and it will become editable. All existing corner points will be marked by a white circle, which you can drag and drop to a new location. Additionally, you can add new points by clicking on any of the semitransparent white circles at the midpoint between existing corners. When you click a semi-transparent point it will become solid and movable to any location, and two new semi-transparent circles will appear to either side of it. To delete an existing point, simply click it and it will turn from solid to semi-transparent. In this way, a neighborhood can be grown, shrunk, or moved in any way you please. That neighborhood's information will update in the left sidebar every time you make any change, no matter how small.

##**2.2. Route to Network**  

"But what if I don't know what neighborhood I want to extend my network to?" you may ask, "What if I know where it needs to end up and I want to know how to get it there and who it may pass along the way?" Well, you needn't worry! VETRO FiberMap^tm^ is here to take care of you. No need to lose sleep. Just click on the <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\2 - Macro Costing\2.2. Routing_toggle.png" height="30" style="vertical-align:middle"> toggle, easy as pie.



###**2.2.1. Route to Network on right-click**  

<div class="doc-section col-md-12">
  <div class="col-md-8">
If you have network points placed in your network, you will be able to use the "Route to Network" tool, regardless of whether or not the network has been built. Simply right-click on the location on the map that you would like to extent fiber to, which will show a small pop-up window with the latitude and longitude coordinates of that location and a "route to network" button. When you click on "route to network" VETRO FiberMap^tm^ will draw a line along the street network from the point you select to the nearest eligible network point. What kind of network point is eligible for such a connection is up to you. We're not about to tell you what to do! You can set which types of network node will be used for routing analytics in Settings and Preferences, as described in [2.3. Settings and Preferences variable options](#section-2.2.2.). If you want to route to the network from a different point, simply click on <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\2 - Macro Costing\2.2.1. Clear_route.png" height="30" style="vertical-align:middle"> and start over by right-clicking on a different location on the map.

###**2.2.2. Route distance display**  

<div class="doc-section col-md-12">
  <div class="col-md-8">
Once a route has been defined, its length will appear measured in feet in the left sidebar.  

 </div>

###**2.2.3. Define neighborhood using route**  

<div class="doc-section col-md-12">
  <div class="col-md-8">
Often, you are not just interested in the length of the route itself, but what it will pass along the way and whether that will make the potential project a successful one. You can click on the <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\2 - Macro Costing\2.2.3. Define_neighborhood_using_route.png" height="30" style="vertical-align:middle"> button in the left side-bar to perform neighborhood-level analysis on the area directly abutting the route to generate a neighborhood that will give you access to all the same information and functionality as the user-defined neighborhoods described in [2.1. Neighborhood-level analysis](#section-2.1.).

Under <img src="Z:\NBT_Solutions\NBT_Projects\NBT_Vetro\VETRO_help_documentation\Markdown Files\2 - Macro Costing\2.3. Cost_and_revenue_button.png" height="30" style="vertical-align:middle"> you can set five variables specific to your business, and built on your own internal business data, with the confidence that this information is secure in our hands.

#####**1. Cost per building**

*1a. Cost to Connect*
>This is the average cost to connect a single residential or commercial building to your network.  
 
*1b. Calculate cost using* 
>Here the average cost may be defined as either the cost to connect a single building to your network or as the average cost per road mile of extending your network.  

#####**2. Revenue (Average)**
*2a. Revenue per Residence*
>Here you may enter the average revenue per month from residential customers connected to your network.  

*2b. Revenue per Business*
>Here you may enter the average revenue per month from business customers connected to your network.

#####3. Take Rate (%)
>Sometimes, despite our best efforts to illuminate them, people choose to remain in the dark. Here you can enter the percentage of reachable customers that you expect to sign up for service on new network extensions. This can either be from your own records, or we can help you refine and increase this number through the use of a dedicated DemandGen (Demand Generation) website.
